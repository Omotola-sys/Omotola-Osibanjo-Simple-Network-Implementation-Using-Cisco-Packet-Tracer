### FIG 1.5- Verification of network connectivity to the PC.
### This pathway shows the verification of the IP address that has been entered. 
### Desktop -> Command Prompt -> Click on it -> Type the command ‚Äúipconfig‚Äù.
### This command displays an IP address, subnet mask, and default gateway assigned to the host or computer.

### FIG 1.6- Verification of network connectivity to the server.
### This pathway shows the verification of the IP address that has been entered. 
### Desktop -> Command Prompt -> Click on it -> Type the command ‚Äúipconfig‚Äù.
### This command displays an IP address, subnet mask, and default gateway assigned to the host or computer.

### FIG 1.7- Verification of network connectivity to the server using the ping command 192.168.0.2
### This shows that we have pinged the server using a ping command from the PC and the command sends 4 ICMP packets of 32 bytes of data, 4 packets sent, and 4 packets received. 
### Round Trip Time (RTT) is a Maximum of 6ms and an Average of 2ms, which means that network connectivity works fine.

### FIG 1.8- Sending Simple Test Messages in Realtime Mode.
### The Add Simple PDU tool was used to send a simple one-time ping message, an echo request, to the server. The server responds with an echo reply because all devices have properly configured IP address settings.
## Part 2: Building of the Complete Network Topology.
### 2. Network Design Overview
### 2.1 Network Topology
### The proposed complete network topology utilizes the following components:
### ‚Ä¢	A Switch: Connects all network segments and devices
### ‚Ä¢	End-User Devices: Additional two Computers and servers
